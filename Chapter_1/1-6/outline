Let us write a program to count the number of occurrences of
each digit, of white space characters (blanks, tab, newline),
and of all other characters.

A array subscript can be any integer expression, which includes
integer variables like i, and integer constants.

Test:
1038 13\t \n dd\n
Result:
1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0, white space = 6, other = 2
