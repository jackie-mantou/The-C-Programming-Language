Exercise 1-10. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab
by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces
visible in an unambiguous way;

Anwser:
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
	if (tab)
		printf("\\t");
	else if (backspace)
		putchar('\b');
	else if (backslash)
		printf("\\\\");
	else
		putchar(c);
}

Problem: Doesn't know how to type a backspace which can be detected by 
the program and replaced by /b
