Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of 
input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

The word count program:
#include <stdio.h>

#define IN	1	/* inside a word */
#define OUT	0	/* outside a word */

/* count lines, words, and characters in input */
int main()
{
	int c, nl, nw, nc, state;

	state = OUT;
	nl = nw = nc = 0;
	while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
		++nc;
		if (c == '\n')
			++nl;
		if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
			state = OUT;
		else if (state == OUT) {
			state = IN;
			++nw;
		}
	}
	printf("nl = %d\nnw = %d\nnc = %d\n", nl, nw, nc);

	return 0;
}

Answer: unusual input, something not logical or not like a human behavior
cover all braches:
1. 0\n \t 13
